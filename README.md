### Requirements

- **Tampermonkey** - Browser extension for userscripts
- **Discord webhook** - For receiving flight reports

### Installation

1. **Install Tampermonkey**
   - [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
   - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
   - [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd)

2. **Install the userscript**
   - Download [SAW.user.js](https://github.com/SAW-flight-logger/SAW-flight-logger/raw/refs/heads/main/SAW.user.js)
   - Open Tampermonkey dashboard
   - Click "Create a new script"
   - Replace the template with the downloaded script content
   - Save the script

3. **Alternative installation**
   - Open GeoFS in your browser
   - Right-click and select "Inspect" (or press F12)
   - Go to the Console tab
   - Copy and paste the script code
   - Press Enter to execute

### Setup

1. **Create Discord webhook**
   - In your Discord server, go to your flight log channel
   - Channel Settings â†’ Integrations â†’ Webhooks
   - Click "New Webhook"
   - Give it a name and copy the webhook URL

   - In GeoFS, look for the SAW Flight Logger panel
   - Click the "+ Add" green button
   - Enter your airline name and ICAO code
   - Paste your Discord webhook URL
   - Select your airline from the dropdown

## Configuration

The script stores configuration locally in your browser:

- **Airlines**: Multiple airline configurations with individual webhook URLs
- **Session data**: Flight progress for recovery after browser refresh
- **User preferences**: Terms agreement and last selected airline

**Important**: The default webhook points to a test server. Make sure to configure your own airline and webhook to avoid sending flight data to the wrong channel.

## Usage

1. **Start a flight**
   - Enter your flight number/callsign (e.g., "516")
   - Click "ðŸ“‹ Start Flight Logger"
   - The script will automatically detect takeoff

2. **During flight**
   - The script monitors your flight continuously
   - Teleportation detection prevents cheating
   - Position and speed data are tracked

3. **Landing and completion**
   - Landing is automatically detected
   - Flight report is generated and sent to Discord
   - Includes departure/arrival airports, duration, landing quality, and flight statistics

4. **Airport database**
   - Uses comprehensive airport database for ICAO detection
   - If airport not found, manual ICAO entry is required
   - Unknown airports will show as "UNKNOWN" in reports
