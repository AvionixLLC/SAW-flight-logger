## Usage Examples

### Basic Flight Logging

```javascript
// 1. Start GeoFS and navigate to an airport
// 2. Enter flight number in the SAW panel (e.g., "516")
// 3. Select your airline from the dropdown
// 4. Click "Start Flight Logger"
// 5. Take off and fly normally
// 6. Landing is detected automatically
```

### Manual ICAO Entry

```javascript
// When the airport isn't in the database:
// 1. The system will prompt for ICAO code
// 2. Enter the 4-letter ICAO (e.g., "KJFK")
// 3. Flight logging continues normally
```

### Managing Airlines

```javascript
// Add new airline:
